What is an Object and a class, what's the difference between them ?  
A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties and behaviors including a valid range of values, and a default value 
An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.

What are the pillars of OOP?
Abstraction- ability to hide things
Encapsulation- binding data and functions for protection
Inheritance- inheriting features of parent class
Polymorphism- the ability to redefine methods for derived classes

Recursion:
	A function which calls itself recursively
	Consists of a base case (stopper) and a recursive case(recurser).

What's the difference between a stack and a queue ?  
Stacks "pop" data off the stack, using last-in first out (LIFO) (ex: books/pancakes)
Queues use first-in, first-out (FIFO) (think of a pipe)

Heap
Priority Queue
Trees

Mixin- a class that contains methods for other classes without having to be the parent class
