* What is an Object and a class, what's the difference between them ?  
A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties and behaviors including a valid range of values, and a default value 
An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.

* What are the pillars of OOP?
	- Abstraction- ability to hide things
	- Encapsulation- binding data and functions for protection
	- Inheritance- inheriting features of parent class
	- Polymorphism- the ability to redefine methods for derived classes

Recursion:
	A function which calls itself recursively
	Consists of a base case (stopper) and a recursive case(recurser).

What's the difference between a stack and a queue ?  
Stacks "pop" data off the stack, using last-in first out (LIFO) (ex: books/pancakes)
Queues use first-in, first-out (FIFO) (think of a pipe)

Heap
Priority Queue
Trees

Mixin- a class that contains methods for other classes without having to be the parent class

# Language Questions:

## Python Questions: 

Python is a high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language.

What are the lists and tuples and what are their differences:
- Both sequence data types (can hold multiple types)
- Lists are mutable - changeable
- Tuples are immutable

Lambda is an anonymous function in Python that can accept any number of arguments, but can only have a single expression. It is generally used in situations requiring an anonymous function for a short time period.

__init__ is a constructor method in Python and is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/instance is created. All classes have a __init__ method associated with them. It helps in distinguishing methods and attributes of a class from local variables.

Self is a keyword in Python used to define an instance or an object of a class. In Python, it is explicitly used as the first parameter, unlike in Java where it is optional. It helps in distinguishing between the methods and attributes of a class from its local variables

Decorators in Python are essentially functions that add functionality to an existing function in Python without changing the structure of the function itself. They are represented by the @decorator_name in Python and are called in bottom-up fashion.

*args can be used to pass multiple  positional arguments
**kwargs can be used to pass multiple  keyword/named arguments

Functions are first-class objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects

PEP8: Python Enhancement Proposal. It is a set of rules that specify how to format Python code for maximum readability.

## JavaScript Questions:

JavaScript is a high level interpreted oop language that is single threaded (no parallelism). It is dynamically typed, and has first-class functions. Multiparadigm language supports: event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. Sets the behavior of web pages.

What is the difference between let and var?
- The let statement declares a block scope local variable. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the var keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

Events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can react to these events.

What is a prototype in javascript?
- All javascript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.

What is the meaning of the keyword this in javascript?
- This is a reference to the object it belongs to

The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. 

What is a promise and what is a callback?
- A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved(for example, network error). It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.
- A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.

## Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA)

Unlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading or multiple inheritance for classes, though multiple inheritance is supported for interfaces.

The keyword public denotes that a method can be called from code in other classes, or that a class may be used by classes outside the class hierarchy. The class hierarchy is related to the name of the directory in which the .java file is located. This is called an access level modifier. Other access level modifiers include the keywords private (a method that can only be accessed in the same class) and protected (which allows code from the same package to access). If a piece of code attempts to access private methods or protected methods, the JVM will throw a SecurityException

The keyword static in front of a method indicates a static method, which is associated only with the class and not with any specific instance of that class. Only static methods can be invoked without a reference to an object. Static methods cannot access any class members that are not also static. Methods that are not designated static are instance methods and require a specific instance of a class to operate.

The keyword void indicates that the main method does not return any value to the caller. If a Java program is to exit with an error code, it must call System.exit() explicitly.
The method name main is not a keyword in the Java language. It is simply the name of the method the Java launcher calls to pass control to the program. A Java program may contain multiple classes that have main methods, which means that the VM needs to be explicitly told which class to launch from.

What is a singleton class in java?
- A singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time. After the first time, if we try to instantiate the Singleton class, the new variable also points to the first instance created.
