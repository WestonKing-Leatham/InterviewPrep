* What is an Object and a class, what's the difference between them ?  
A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties and behaviors including a valid range of values, and a default value 
An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.

* What are the pillars of OOP?
	- Abstraction- ability to hide things
	- Encapsulation- binding data and functions for protection
	- Inheritance- inheriting features of parent class
	- Polymorphism- the ability to redefine methods for derived classes

Recursion:
	A function which calls itself recursively
	Consists of a base case (stopper) and a recursive case(recurser).

What's the difference between a stack and a queue ?  
Stacks "pop" data off the stack, using last-in first out (LIFO) (ex: books/pancakes)
Queues use first-in, first-out (FIFO) (think of a pipe)

Heap
Priority Queue
Trees

Mixin- a class that contains methods for other classes without having to be the parent class

# Language Questions:

##Python Questions: 
Python is a high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language.

What are the lists and tuples and what are their differences:
Both sequence data types (can hold multiple types)
Lists are mutable - changeable
Tuples are immutable

Lambda is an anonymous function in Python that can accept any number of arguments, but can only have a single expression. It is generally used in situations requiring an anonymous function for a short time period.

__init__ is a constructor method in Python and is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/instance is created. All classes have a __init__ method associated with them. It helps in distinguishing methods and attributes of a class from local variables.

Self is a keyword in Python used to define an instance or an object of a class. In Python, it is explicitly used as the first parameter, unlike in Java where it is optional. It helps in distinguishing between the methods and attributes of a class from its local variables

Decorators in Python are essentially functions that add functionality to an existing function in Python without changing the structure of the function itself. They are represented by the @decorator_name in Python and are called in bottom-up fashion.

*args can be used to pass multiple  positional arguments
**kwargs can be used to pass multiple  keyword/named arguments

Functions are first-class objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects

PEP8: Python Enhancement Proposal. It is a set of rules that specify how to format Python code for maximum readability.
